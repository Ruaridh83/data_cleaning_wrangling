Loaded in the dataframe "decathlon.rds" for cleaning and analysis. 

```{r}
decathlon %>%
  clean_names()

```

Turns out i want better column names, so i've changed them. Renamed them manually for more control. 


I need an identifier for each row so turned the row names into a column. 

```{r}

decath <- rownames_to_column(decathlon, "athlete_name")
decath

```
I need the athletes names all in either upper or lower so they act the same if i'm looking across both competitions. 

```{r}
decath <- decath %>% 
  mutate(athlete_name = str_to_lower(athlete_name))

decath

```
Who had the longest long jump seen in the data? used max function and selected long jump as the argument within to return the highest value. 

```{r}

max(decath$long_Jump)

```
What was the average 100m time in each competition? First i'll find the average of all 100m entries across both competitions. 

```{r}
avg_100m <- mean(decath$"x100m")
avg_100m
```

```{r}
olympic = filter(decath,competition=="OlympicG")
olympic
```
The average time for an olympic 100m is 10.91571 seconds
```{r}
olympic_100m <- mean(olympic$"x100m")
olympic_100m
```

```{r}
decastar = filter(decath,competition=="Decastar")
decastar
```
The average decastar 100m is 11.17538 seconds. 

```{r}
decastar_100m <- mean(decastar$"x100m")
decastar_100m
```

Who had the highest total points across both competitions?

First i've pivoted the table longer to have fewer columns and make the data more manageable. 

```{r}
decath_long <- decath %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = ("x100m":"x1500m"), 
               names_to = "event", 
               values_to = "result")
decath_long
```
Here i've returned the athlete with the highest points total between the Olympics & Decastar. 

```{r}
decath_long %>%
  distinct(athlete_name, competition, points) %>%
  group_by(athlete_name) %>%
  summarise(points_total = sum(points)) %>%
  arrange(desc(points_total)) %>%
  head(1)
```

What was the shot-put scores for the top three competitors in each competition?

```{r}
decath_long %>%
  filter(event == "shot_put", rank <= 3) 
```

What was the average points for competitors who ran the 400m in less than 50 seconds vs. those than ran 400m in more than 50 seconds?

Here's the points average of those athletes who ran the 400m in less than 50 seconds. 

```{r}
decath_long %>%
  filter(event == "x400m", result <= 50) %>%
  summarise_at(c("points"), mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```
Here's the points average of those athletes who ran the 400m in more than 50 seconds. 

```{r}
decath_long %>%
  filter(event == "x400m", result >= 50) %>%
  summarise_at(c("points"), mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
write_csv(decath_long, "../")
```

```{r}
Here()

```
